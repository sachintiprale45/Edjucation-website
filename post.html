                <h3>Learn Web Development In The Easist Way</h3>
                <p>Full Stack Development refers to the development of both front end(client side)
                    and back end(server side) portions of web application.Full
                    stack web developers have the ability to design complete web
                    applications and websites.They work on the frontend, backend, database and debugging of web
                    applications
                    or websites</p>
                <p>The world of full-stack development is large, and many new and evolving technologies continually push
                    the limits
                    of what a full-stack developer can create. Staying on top of cutting-edge technology and techniques
                    in the full-stack
                    development field is one of the many exciting aspects of working in this role.</p>
                <p>Client Software (Front End)
                    Client software, also known as a front end, is a type of software that interacts with users. It is
                    responsible for
                    the graphical user interface (GUI) that users see and interact with. It allows users to access and
                    use the features and
                    functions of the underlying software or system. Client software typically runs on a user's local
                    machine instead of being hosted on a remote server.
                    In many cases, the client software makes the user's experience with a particular system or
                    application possible.</p>
                <p>Server software, also known as the back-end software, is responsible for managing and coordinating
                    the activities of the server.
                    It is responsible for ensuring that the server is up and running and that all the different server
                    components are functioning correctly.
                    Server software also provides an interface for users to interact with the server and for
                    administrators to manage the server.
                    Some popular server software programs include Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS, and Nginx. These
                    programs handle server-side tasks
                    like hosting web pages, taking user requests, and sending responses.
                    To run a website or application, you will need to have a server running server software. This
                    software allows users to interact with your
                    site or application. Without server software, there would be no way for users to request data or
                    information from your site.

                    Server software is an integral part of any website or application. It is essential for anyone who
                    wants to run a website or application to have a basic understanding of how it works.</p>
                <p>Full stack development provides a faster and more efficient development experience to build web
                    applications, as team members
                    are equipped with the knowledge of various technologies and tools and can use their diverse
                    knowledge for development as well as future research.
                    The two most popular technology stacks—i.e., MEAN stack and MERN stack—use MongoDB as their core
                    database, which has a flexible
                    schema and provides scalability and high availability for any project size.</p>
